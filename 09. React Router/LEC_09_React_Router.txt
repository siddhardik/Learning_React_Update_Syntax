Single Page Applications don't allow Server Side Routing as it triggers a page refresh. SPAs load the complete app on mount, and when the user navigates to a new page, they don't necessarily need to request data from the server again.

Single Page Applications can be built using Conditional Rendering, which does not reload the page when a new component is rendered.

For Routing we have to use a third-party library 

npm install react-router-dom

The react-router-dom library offers multiple routers to implement routing, and the recommended way to implement routing in web projects is to use the createBrowserRouter.

The base address of the Twitter web app is www.twitter.com, and /explore is the route used by the Client Side Router to uniquely identify and load the explore page of the Twitter web app.

Since we are not providing the router prop to RouterProvider, it will fail to route to the Home and About components on their specified routes.

import {Link } from "react-router-dom";



<Link to ="/about" >About</Link>

Link is a tag It is wrapper around a tag 

The Link element in React Router is a wrapper around the anchor element that prevents hard page reload. It allows programmatic navigation based on user actions like clicks.
