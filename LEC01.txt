01 .++> Why React => React is Composable !  Code Reusability !
Compoent Once Use it many Times ! React helps creating Single page Application Contain just one html page !


02. ++> SPA Vs MPA 

  => Multi -page Application is traditional implementation of web application which reloads the whole page when user interacts with the app. Every time many post request for carry fulll html file .

  => SPA loads a single document {HTML} and update the parts of the document using javascript APIs (AJAX).Single-page applications dynamically updates the contents of a page based on user interaction without having to reload the page. Since this dynamic content is difficult to crawl, SPAâ€™s are less suitable for SEO

Amazon uses MPA beacuse its SEO .

++> React is Declarative !!

Tell , what you want to do ? not how!
React is declarative because it describes the desired outcome, not the specific steps to achieve it. This allows for more efficient updates to the DOM, eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulation, and makes it easier to understand the code. 


Being ReactDOM is a virtual DOM . It is very Faster that makes react more fast.


ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.

When we try to update the DOM in React, the entire Virtual DOM is updated and compared to what it looked like before the update in a process called diffing. These changes are then updated on the Real DOM.

Babel is a javascript Compiler.

JSX => Javascript XML {javascript With HTML}[Syntactic Sugar]

browser only understands html css js , if we write somrthing other we have to convert it into these area.
