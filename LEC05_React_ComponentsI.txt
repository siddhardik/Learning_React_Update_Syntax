Components  => Class Based  // Function Based 

Render onl;y on available in class Component 

In case of export default, a single App component is getting exported, hence there is no need to extract it while importing it. But since there can be multiple exports in the case of using named export, hence we need to use the destructure concept using {}.

We are importing a react object. To get the component class, we need to restructure it like this → 

    import {Component} from “react”;

States is Built -in -Object , single source of truth 
In general you can decide to use mutability or immutability, but React requires state to be immutable. 

We can use handler functions without binding them to the component but they will lose reference to the current component instance when triggered once. The ES6 concise method syntax does not bind the handler to the component. This can be done using arrow functions.

= [ Second use of state]
setState()  to rerender the component 

this.setState(
{
stars:this.state.stars + 0.5;

})



More  About setState 

//Form1 
 this.setState({
            star:this.state.star + 0.5
        })


If many setState function  is called then all above will be not executed only the last one will be executed and react does it .

This is called batching.



Form2// 
  this.setState((prevState) => {
            return {
                star: prevState + 0.5
            }
        })

but for the second form if this.setState is called 3 times it will be increased by 1.5.


React groups multiple state updates into a single rerender for better performance. So only the last call to setState is executed after the button is clicked hence with an initial value of count as 1 will become 5 after the button is clicked. For from 1
