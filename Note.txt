01 .++> Why React => React is Composable !  Code Reusability !
Compoent Once Use it many Times ! React helps creating Single page Application Contain just one html page !


02. ++> SPA Vs MPA 

  => Multi -page Application is traditional implementation of web application which reloads the whole page when user interacts with the app. Every time many post request for carry fulll html file .

  => SPA loads a single document {HTML} and update the parts of the document using javascript APIs (AJAX).Single-page applications dynamically updates the contents of a page based on user interaction without having to reload the page. Since this dynamic content is difficult to crawl, SPAâ€™s are less suitable for SEO

Amazon uses MPA beacuse its SEO .

++> React is Declarative !!
