JSX is a Syntax Extension to JavaScript .

Advantages Of JSX =>
1. It helps to couple rendering logic with the UI logic
2. It separates concerns instead of separating      technologies.
3. It helps React to show more useful error and warning messages

We need to call the function with parameter inside the JSX using { }.

JSX can only have a single expression to render inside of the UI. However, We can create a parent element or use React fragments to group the UI elements into a single expression.

The code does not render anything because of missing parenthesis around the JSX expression. It resolves to a null value because of the implicit return.

JSX does not work with only open tag we have to use closed </> also 

Loops do not return any values. So they are not valid expressions and cannot be used to render JSX. Objects are not valid as a React child. We cannot directly render them inside JSX.

Loops are just a series of statements that executes for a specified number of repetitions or until specified conditions are met. They do not return any value.

The map method receives the current item in the array iteration as the argument to the callback function.

Keys are used in React to identify which items have been updated or deleted in a list. It is not a required property but is necessary to ensure good optimization.
